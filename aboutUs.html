            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>BiaBao was formerly known as Jalan Jalan, a well-loved franchise with locations in several Irish towns. However, the owner sought to create a unique identity separate from the other Jalan Jalan restaurants. This led to a rebranding, giving birth to BiaBao. While our name and branding have changed, our commitment to authentic flavours remains the same. We continue to serve the delicious dishes our customers love, now with a few exciting new additions to the menu.</p>

            <h2>Our Vision</h2>
            <article>
                <p>At BiaBao, we believe in bringing people together over the joy of food. Our vision is to create an unforgettable dining experience that celebrates the rich, diverse flavours of Chinese and Asian fusion cuisine. Inspired by traditional cooking methods and infused with modern innovation, we aim to serve dishes that not only nourish the body but also bring warmth and connection to every table.</p>
                <p>We are committed to:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Authenticity and Quality:</strong> We take pride in using the finest ingredients to deliver dishes that are both authentic and creative. Our chefs carefully craft each meal with attention to detail, ensuring every bite is full of flavour and texture.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cultural Experience:</strong> At BiaBao, we don't just serve food; we offer a journey. A journey through the flavours, aromas, and traditions of Asia, blended seamlessly with contemporary techniques and global influences.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sustainability:</strong> We believe in responsible dining. We strive to source locally and sustainably, minimising our environmental footprint while supporting the community.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hospitality and Community:</strong> We see ourselves as more than just a restaurant. BiaBao is a place where families, friends, and loved ones come together to create lasting memories.
